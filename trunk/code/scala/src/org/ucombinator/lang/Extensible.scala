/**

  An Extensible object can store arbitrary properties.

  The primary purpose of Extensibile is to allow implicits to attach local information to an object.

  For example, an abstract syntax tree node class could be made Extensible, 
  if the class author expects annotations to be added to nodes by third parties, 
  such as a static analyzer suite.
